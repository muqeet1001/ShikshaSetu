## Current Status

âœ… **Fully Completed:**
- âœ“ Basic project setup with Expo and TypeScript
- âœ“ Navigation system with React Navigation
- âœ“ Complete UI component library (Button, Card, Input, Label, Select, Checkbox, Badge)

- Add multi-language support (Hindi/Urdu)
- Enhanced animations and micro-interactions
- Push notifications for important updates
- Offline functionality with local storage

## Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start Expo development server
- `npm run android` - Start on Android emulator
- `npm run ios` - Start on iOS simulator (macOS only)
- `npm run web` - Start web version

## Converting Original React Components

The original React web app used:
- **Radix UI components** â†’ Converted to custom React Native components
- **Tailwind CSS classes** â†’ Converted to StyleSheet objects
- **State-based navigation** â†’ Replaced with React Navigation
- **HTML elements** (div, button) â†’ React Native components (View, TouchableOpacity)

Each screen can be individually converted from the original `/src/components/screens/` directory by:
1. Replacing HTML elements with React Native components
2. Converting CSS classes to StyleSheet objects  
3. Updating navigation calls to use React Navigation
4. Testing on mobile devices through Expo

## Contributing

When adding new screens or components:
1. Follow the existing TypeScript patterns
2. Use the established styling approach with StyleSheet
3. Update the navigation types in `src/types/index.ts`
4. Test on both iOS and Android platforms

## Troubleshooting

**Metro Bundler Issues:**
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

**Navigation Errors:**
- Ensure all screen names in navigation match the type definitions
- Check that all screens are properly registered in App.tsx

**Styling Issues:**
- React Native uses flexbox by default
- Use `StyleSheet.create()` instead of CSS classes
- Test layouts on multiple screen sizes
