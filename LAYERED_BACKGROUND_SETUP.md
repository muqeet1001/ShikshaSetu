# Professional Layered Background Setup for ShikshaSetu

## 🎯 Current Implementation

Your app now has a **professional layered background system**:

### Layer Structure:
1. **Layer 1**: Faded background image (35% opacity) - full screen coverage
2. **Layer 2**: J&K Government Emblem (85% opacity) - crisp overlay, slightly upper center
3. **Layer 3**: App content - on top with full visibility

## 📋 To Complete the Setup:

### Step 1: Add Background Image
1. **Save your background image** as `background.jpg`
2. **Place it in**: `C:\Users\abdul muqeet\Videos\CareerCompass\assets\background.jpg`
3. **Ensure it's high quality** - it will be displayed full screen

### Step 2: Current Behavior
- ✅ **With background.jpg**: Layered professional design
- ✅ **Without background.jpg**: Clean solid background with J&K emblem
